# Invincible Man

Invincible Man is an 8-bit game designed similarly to the old 2D Mario games. The game features a main character named the Dan the Cave Man who must traverse the map and not be killed by his enemies.

## Technologies Used

The relies heavy on `Javascript` for its running. The game takes place on a canvas HTML element which allows one to place objects on an infinite canvas and access those elements via their x and y positions. `JQuery` is also used in this program in order to manipulate the DOM. All images used are sprites found on the internet including the characters as well as the ground platforms and lava. The webpage is setup with `HTML` and styled with `CSS` as usual.

## Extra Aid

## Game Play

Players have the ability to run left and right through the use of the arrow keys as well as jump with the up arrow. The character only has the ability to single jump. The player will have to jump over lava pits as well as empty trenches. The character experiences gravity so it's important for the player to keep the character on the stage. Along the way, the player will encounter enemies whom he can jump on top, throw a rock at, or stab to kill. To throw a rock, the player must press the spacebar. In order to stab, the player must press the shift key. The player can only walk forward on the map. Once the left edge of the map moves forward, it can not move back.
